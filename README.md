These files are examples of the assignments I had to do for my Javascript-DHTML class. I was given an application needed by a mock client, and had to create the files necessary to do the required task. In these examples, I use various techniques revolving around Javascript and HTML methodologies. This class helped me gain confidence in using Javascipt and DHTML, and assisted in the creation of my portfolio (viewable from my Resume).
